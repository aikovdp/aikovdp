## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Aiko, a Software Engineering student at HOGENT.

- ðŸ”­ You may know me from [Rokucraft](https://github.com/Rokucraft), where I lead the Development team in bringing our world to life.
- âœ¨ Iâ€™ve made a wide variety of plugins for the Minecraft server, such as [RokuAnnouncer](https://github.com/Rokucraft/RokuAnnouncer), [RokuNick](https://github.com/Rokucraft/RokuNick), [RokuShop](https://github.com/Rokucraft/RokuShop) and [RokuWear](https://github.com/Rokucraft/RokuWear), each responsible for a distinct set features.
- ðŸ¤– I also created [RokuBot](https://github.com/Rokucraft/RokuBot), a Discord bot that helps us manage our community and work together as a team.
